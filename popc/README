A) "system" folder 
System: POPC membrane
- 294 lipids (147 on each leaflet of the bilayer)
- 200 mM NaCl
- 77406 atoms total   
- file names: popc.psf and popc.pdb 

B) "namd" folder 
Simulation configurations  
- eqpopcfsw.conf (vdW force switching on) and eqpopc.conf (vdW force switching off)
- simulation conditions: 310K, 1atm (NPT ensemble)   
- 5-ns simulation time

Log files generated (*log) 

C) "output" folder 
- *coor, *dcd, *vel, *xsc, *xst   
- *dat :total energy, potential energy, pressure, temperature, area, volume, vdW energy and electrocstatic energy 


D) major differences 
- Total energy, potential energy and vdW energy values are more positive when vdW force switching is on. VdW energies are about zero kcal/mol. 
- Area and Volume are larger when vdW force switching is on.
